npm install jsonresume-theme-onepage

right now I consider resume_fresh.json to be the golden source for text and wording,
	though there are some changes from cv.md I want to bring in.

word version is missing my contact info
box next to firmware box is red, fix it
add projects and old internships
fonts should be bigger in employment section

doc isn't showing up the same in libreoffice as it is in word

hackmyresume BUILD resume.json TO out/resume.html



hackmyresume BUILD resume_fresh.json TO asdf/resume.html -t node_modules/jsonresume-theme-stackoverflow // I like this theme so far
classy theme might be better. at the very least its nice and bold.
